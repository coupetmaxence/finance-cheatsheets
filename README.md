# Finance cheatsheets

Different short documents about key topics in finance. Those documents are not courses but more notes in order to remember the most important notions right before a job interview for example. The topics will be on mathematics (stochastic calculus applied to finance, differential equations, Taylor series, ...), derivatives and pricing methods.

Those documents are deeply inspired (and sometimes just summaries) of two books : *Exotic Options and Hybrid* and *Options, Futures and other derivatives*.
